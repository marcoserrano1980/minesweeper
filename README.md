<h2>Usage</h2>

<div style="width: 100%; float: left">
	<p>
		To play Minesweeper, simply use your mouse or keyboard to select a square on the game board. The game board is filled with squares, some of which contain mines that will explode when clicked. The numbers on each square indicate how many adjacent squares contain mines. Your objective is to clear the board of all squares that do not contain mines, without detonating any mines.

	    Minesweeper also features adjustable difficulty levels, which can be set by changing the size of the game board and the number of mines.
